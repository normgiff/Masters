<p>
In 2014, Daniel and Norman, along with two other students (Tyler Martinsen and Ruben Gottardi, who both graduated in Spring 2015), created an ASIC tester for their senior project. The project idea was initially proposed by School of Computing professor Erik Brunvand, who at the time had correctly predicted the short remaining life of the LV500. Daniel took great interest in the idea and proposed it to Norman, Tyler, and Ruben, all of whom took interest in the idea as well.
</p>
<p>
The initial goal behind our project was to create an ASIC tester that could fully replace the LV500. This goal ultimately proved too ambitious, however, as at the time, it wasn't clear (or feasible) how to mimic some of the LV500's functions, such as schmooing and real-time testing. Later, we reframed our project as a functional ASIC tester that could provide the ground work for a later project that could more closely mimic the LV500's functionality. Afterwards, Norman and Daniel (now graduate students in computer engineering) decided for their master's project to create a new ASIC tester, using what was learned from their senior project experience.
