<p>
<b>1/4/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Norm</b> created a demo in which he reads and reports a thermistor's values by utilizing the BBB's ADCs. Also, Norm installed MySQL and has toyed around with it a bit -- he will update his demo to write the thermistor values into a database table. Also, Norm will look into displaying a chart of the data read from the thermistor, which is relevant as we will do a similar display for schmooing results.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> created sketches of the main and power PCBs and will work further on defining the protocols to and from the BBB. He has decided to use the AD5293 digital potentiometer and is investigating using ZIF sockets or PCI form factors to connect a Numato shield to the main PCB.
<br>
<b>By next week</b>, Norm will have gotten his hands wet with MySQL and displaying data on the web server, and Daniel will further refine his PCB designs. Norm is also looking into the SPI drivers on the BBB.
</p>

<p>
<b>1/11/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Norm</b> has looked into enabling SPI on the BBB and will continue working with mySQL.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> is working on a shield for the Numato board (with equilibrium tracing). He plans to have the Gerber files ready by Friday.
</p>


<p>
<b>1/19/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Norm</b> will continue working on SPI, my SQL, and will reorganize our repository a bit.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> is halfway complete with the Numato shield and will have it ready by Friday.
</p>

<p>
<b>1/25/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> completed the Numato shield and has sent it out for fabrication. The board should be in our hands around February 3rd. For more information, please see the <a href="design_work_pcbs.html">Design Work: PCBs</a> page.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> and <b>Norm</b> will now work together on the "main PCB" and the power PCB, which we consider to be the heart of the project. We hope to have all of our hardware done by the end of Spring Break, allowing us to spend the remainder of the semester on software development.
