<p>Note: We may skip updating this page for a week if we don't have too much to report on that is different from our last weekly report.</p>

<p>
<b>1/4/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Norm</b> created a demo in which he reads and reports a thermistor's values by utilizing the BBB's ADCs. Also, Norm installed MySQL and has toyed around with it a bit -- he will update his demo to write the thermistor values into a database table. Also, Norm will look into displaying a chart of the data read from the thermistor, which is relevant as we will do a similar display for schmooing results.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> created sketches of the main and power PCBs and will work further on defining the protocols to and from the BBB. He has decided to use the AD5293 digital potentiometer and is investigating using ZIF sockets or PCI form factors to connect a Numato shield to the main PCB.
<br>
<b>By next week</b>, Norm will have gotten his hands wet with MySQL and displaying data on the web server, and Daniel will further refine his PCB designs. Norm is also looking into the SPI drivers on the BBB.
</p>

<p>
<b>1/11/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Norm</b> has looked into enabling SPI on the BBB and will continue working with mySQL.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> is working on a shield for the Numato board (with equilibrium tracing). He plans to have the Gerber files ready by Friday.
</p>


<p>
<b>1/19/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Norm</b> will continue working on SPI, my SQL, and will reorganize our repository a bit.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> is halfway complete with the Numato shield and will have it ready by Friday.
</p>

<p>
<b>1/25/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> completed the Numato shield and has sent it out for fabrication. The board should be in our hands around February 3rd. For more information, please see the <a href="design_work_pcbs.html">Design Work: PCBs</a> page.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> and <b>Norm</b> will now work together on the "main PCB" and the power PCB, which we consider to be the heart of the project. We hope to have all of our hardware done by the end of Spring Break, allowing us to spend the remainder of the semester on software development.
</p>

<p>
<b>2/3/2016:</b>
<br>
The Numato board is complete and soldered! Please see the <a href="design_work_pcbs.html">Design Work: PCBs</a> page.
<br>
<b>Norm</b> is currently investigating SPI on the BBB (he believes he has it enabled but is working on a demo to ensure that it is working). He also has looked at tristate buffer ICs and shift registers for our project.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> ordered a counter, SRAM, and breakout boards from various places on the Internet and will test using a counter to address SRAM using an FPGA board. By the end of next week, we plan to have demos for our SPI and SRAM/counter idea and will purchase and prototype shift registers and tristate buffers. We will also discuss the power circuitry and whether we will use all 139 pins from the FPGA board to the DUT or just 84.
<br>
Near the end of February, after we finish prototyping, Norm and Daniel will collaborate closely to create the remaining PCBs for this project. We hope to submit our PCB Gerber files for fabrication no later than the beginning of Spring Break.
</p>

<p>
<b>2/9/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Norm</b> will soon purchase tristate buffer ICs and shift registers for our project.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> is almost done with his counter/SRAM demo will have it ready soon.
<br>
This week, we had to take a break from the project due to tests and projects due this week. We'll be resuming our regular pace very soon!
</p>

<p>
<b>2/16/2016:</b>
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> finished his SRAM/counter demo. Check out a video of his demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8553T59wSk&feature=youtu.be">here</a>.<br>
<b>Norm</b> and <b>Daniel</b> will begin the remaining two boards for this project. We are still on track to have both boards sent for fabricated by the beginning of Spring Break, approximately one month from now.
</p>

<p>
<b>2/29/2016:</b>
<br>
Norm and Daniel were busy last week and didn't have time to provide an update. Sorry!
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> and <b>Norm</b> are nearly complete with schematics for their PCBs and will spend this week working on PCB layout. We will also ensure that our schematics are correct through rigorous explanation of operation.
<br>
<b>Daniel</b> also purchased a voltage translator and concluded that schmooing should be acceptable between 3.5V and 5V.
<br>
<br>
Our contemporary schedule is to rigorously verify that our schematics are correct this week and complete the PCB layout (but not routing) next week. During Spring Break, we will route the boards and submit them for fabrication. Starting on the week of March 21 onward, our time will be split between BBB/Verilog development and hardware development.
</p>

<p>
<b>03/16/2016:</b>
<br>
Norm and Daniel are still working on their PCB boards. One of the boards has its layout done (sans routing) and we should have the layout (sans routing) of the other board done by end-of-day, 03/17/2016. We still plan to send the boards for fabrication by 03/25/2016 and will order all of our parts shortly before that date. Pictures of our PCBs will be posted as soon as we route them! :)
<br>
<br>
Current schedule/milestones:<br>
<b>03/25/2016:</b> Send both PCB boards for fabrication, begin working on Verilog.<br>
<b>03/26/2016 - 04/04/2016:</b> Complete as much of the Verilog and BBB website interface as we can, retrieve PCB boards.<br>
<b>04/08/2016 - 04/15/2016:</b> Solder a minimal number of components onto the boards and test them. If the boards work, solder all the remaining components.<br>
<b>04/15/2016 - 05/01/2016:</b> Finish Verilog, continue working on BBB interface.<br>
<b>05/02/2016 - 05/10/2016:</b> Write up final report and extensive documentation.<br>
Note: As always, time gets in the way; we may not have time to get to some features such as a database for test results. Our goal is to have the entire system ready except for the BBB interface; the extensive documentation will allow a future student/faculty member to continue working on the project. We plan to donate our project to the University with the hope that the project itself, or the ideas behind the project, may serve to benefit others.

<br>
One of our boards (the DUT board) is ready for fabrication!<br>
You can see the Gerber files <a href="https://www.freedfm.com/freedfm/0025139904379862/results/plots.htm">here</a>.<br>
You can see the FreeDFM results <a href="https://www.freedfm.com/freedfm/0025139904379862/results/summary2.htm">here</a>.<br>
You can see the multilayer PDF <a href="https://www.freedfm.com/freedfm/0025139904379862/FreeDFM-v2.0/freeDFM.pdf">here</a>.<br>
With this board done, we can now work on the Beagleone Black board (the DUT board is harder to route, so we needed to establish a working design before working on the layout of the BeagleBone Black board).<br>
We believe we are on track to have both boards sent for fabrication by 03/25 (Friday). Note that the BeagleBone Black's board's schematic is mostly complete, and most of the work that remains is the PCB layout/routing.<br>
We figured out how to utilize Altium's rules and autorouter effectively, which is nice. :)
