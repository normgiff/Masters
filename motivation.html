<p>
The University of Utah offers a VLSI (very large scale integration) class that is required for students mastering in computer engineering. Thanks in part to the MOSIS foundry, this class provides students the opportunity to design and fabricate an integrated circuit onto a chip.
</p>
<p>
For chips that are manufactured for educational purposes, MOSIS requires a report detailing the chip's expected and actual functionality. The University of Utah provides two machines to abet students in testing their chips: a Tektronix LV500 and a Verigy 93000. These machines are known as <i>logic verifiers</i>, or <i>ASIC testers</i>. The core idea behind these machines is conceptually simple: the user provides a chip and tells the machine what outputs to expect from the chip when certain kinds of inputs are applied. The machine applies the inputs, checks the outputs, and reports to the user whether the chip's outputs matches the expected output values or not.
</p>
<p>
The LV500, developed in the late 1980s, is simple to use but failing; replacement parts have become harder to find as time has passed. The Verigy 93000 mostly works but is very difficult to operate. Purchasing a new logic verifier is out of the question, as these machines cost thousands if not millions of dollars. As such, Norman and Daniel are working toward creating the <i>LV600</i> (also known as the LV500+, or the LV500 Slim), a low-cost logic verifier that the University of Utah can provide to students wishing to test their MOSIS-fabricated chips.
